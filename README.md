# Group_project
Me and kyle collaborated  on this project to take it where it is, although we initially planned on implementing features seperately and then merging them
but we still helped each other out when issues arose.
In this projects Kyle assisted  in finding the appropriate textures for this terrain and also helped to integrate the skydome 
to the terrain project.
